Synergy4
============

Synergy4 is a framework for statistic-multiplexed, resilient and scalable high-performance computing.

## Brief intro

Requirements:
	- `libzmq-4.2,libczmq-3.0+` for networking functionalities (ZeroMQ)
	- `mongodb-dev,libbson` for parser implementation (MongoDB's bson library)
	- `CMake > 3.5` for building
	- POSIX-compliance for shared memory; shared memory size must be greater than 4MB.
	- `pthreads` support

The entire framework is composed of a few parts, listed below:
	- `libzlog,libchash` supporting libraries for logging and a hash table
	- `p2pmd` a peer-to-peer application-level routing overlay using ring topology. This guarantees maximal availability of synergy4 computation and dynamic, runtime scalability.
	- `parser` uses `libbson` to parse an `sng-config.json` file
	- `tsd` is the tuple-space daemon
	- `libts` is the client-side header/static library that is linked against the user application during compile time
	- `libcnf-compat` is a compatibility wrapper for old Synergy (Synergy 3.0-) applications. It does not support all API calls, so some modifications on the program is required.
 (Note: `libcnf-compat` is also a header/static library that is linked against user application during compile time).

To build Synergy4, make a new directory, and type in `cmake ../ && make`.
